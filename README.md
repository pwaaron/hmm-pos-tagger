# Twitter Parts-of-Speech Tagging using Hidden Markov Model: Viterbi Algorithm
Project Submission for BT3102 Computational Methodologies for Business Analytics Fall 2019

Built a Parts-of-Speech (POS) Tagger using of Tweets based on the Hidden Markov Model using the Viterbi Algorithm. 

viterbi.py is the base code while viterbi2.py is the improved POS tagger (improvement by detecting unregistered tokens).

Credits goes to Prof. Stanley Kok for the skeleton code and the assignment itself.
